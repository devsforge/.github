## Our Stance on the War in :ukraine:Ukraine

DevsForge stands with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people in the ongoing war of
aggression by the Russian Federation. We condemn this illegal invasion and the
humanitarian crisis it has caused.

While we welcome contributors from around the world, we expect all community
members to respect our values and the dignity of the Ukrainian people. We will
not tolerate pro-war rhetoric, denial of war crimes, or justification of
aggression against Ukraine in our community spaces.

Our community is built on principles of peace, human rights, and mutual
respect. Those who cannot uphold these principles are not welcome here.

### Support Ukraine

## Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and maintainers of DevsForge, pledge to make
participation in our community a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an environment where specialists can grow, learn,
and collaborate openly. As a Ukrainian-based organization, we are proud to
promote Ukraine and Ukrainian talent worldwide, while remaining inclusive and
welcoming to contributors from all backgrounds.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, friendly,
transparent, and engaged community.
